## [Unreleased]

- Nothing yet

## [v0.4.0] - 2021-10-06
- Fixed issues where fields in structs that were not defined in the schema raised errors (array, slice, time, map)
- Added support for reflect encoding/decoding of additional types to/from parquet types
    - Go type <-> Parquet type
    - int     <-> int64
    - int32   <-> int64
    - int16   <-> int64
    - int8    <-> int64
    - uint    <-> int64
    - uint16  <-> int64
    - uint8   <-> int64
    - int64   <-> int32
    - uint64  <-> int32
    - uint32  <-> int32
- Removed some inconsistent api behaviors
    - reflect marshaling/unmarshalling now ignores fields not defined in the schema (this already happens when
      the marshaller is used by floor.Writer and goparquet.FileReader)
    - int32PlainDecoder and int32PlainEncoder now no longer support uint values
- Added function `IsAfterUnixEpoch` to allow test whether a timestamp can be written as Julian date.
- Allowed setting selected columns after opening a parquet file through `SetSelectedColumns` method.
- Fixed `dictStore` to correctly reset `valueSize` which should reduce size of written files.
- Fixed reflection-based marshal/unmarshaling for some basic types.
- Fixed `DECIMAL`s computation of maximum amount of digits.
- Improved parsing of legacy timestamps.
- Allowed reading of file metadata before properly opening a parquet file.
- Added method `SeekToRowGroup` to allow seeking to specific row groups.

## [v0.3.0] - 2020-12-15
- Added examples how to use the low-level and high-level APIs.
- Added backwards compability in floor reader and writer for lists as produced by Athena.
- Fixed many crash issues found during fuzzing of the parquet reader.

## [v0.2.1] - 2020-11-04
- Release to correct missing changelog.

## [v0.2.0] - 2020-11-04
- Added `csv2parquet` command to convert CSV files into parquet files
- Fixed issue in `parquet-tool cat` that wouldn't print any records if no limit was provided
- Added support for backward compatible MAPs and LISTs in schema validation
- Added ValidateStrict method to validate without regard for backwards compatibility

## [v0.1.1] - 2020-05-26
- Added high-level interface to access file and column metadata

## [v0.1.0] - 2020-04-24
- Initial release
